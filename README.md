# WaifUPnP 

UPnP Port Forwarding for Java couldn't be any easier!

WaifUPnP is an _extremely_ lightweight Java library that allows you to:

- open/close TCP/UDP ports
- check if there's an UPnP router available
- check if a port is already mapped

using literally 1 line of code, as it should be! 

It's as easy as:

```java
UPnP.openTCP(<port number here>);
```

Usage Examples are included.

## Usage

To compile, import the project in Netbeans.
Alternatively, download the binaries from http://fdossena.com/?p=waifupnp/index.frag

Once you have the .jar files:

- Import `WaifUPnP.jar` into your application
- Optionally, import `WaifUPnP-javadoc.jar` if you need JavaDoc
- `WaifUPnP-sources.jar` contains the source code and should not be imported into your project

## Compatibility

Java 6 and newer

## Limitations

WaifUPnP is a very basic implementation of UPnP, that only scans for the default gateway, and can only open/close ports.

While this is enough for most people, if you need a full implementation of UPnP, you should take a look at [Cling](http://4thline.org/projects/cling/)
